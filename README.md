# Snake Python Hermes

This is a Team Hermes implementation of Snake, written in PyGame.

# Recommended tools

To develop Python in Windows, install the following tools
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (use bash from here in Pycharm) 
- [Python 3.8](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSSZTT1N39L)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies. When choosing the run configuration
in PyCharm, I recommend creating a virtualenv enviroment only for this project. After doing that, packages specific to
this project can be installed with pip.

```bash
pip install pygame
```
